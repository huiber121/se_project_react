**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Simple web page is built with react.js that tells user what clothing should wear during the specific weather.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
